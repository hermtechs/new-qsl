Just like football, music unites people and I am happy to be able to contribute to this at the FIFA Fan Festival – it‘s going to be epic!” – Trinidad Cardona</p>

            alt="Music artist Diplo for FIFA Sound world cup Qatar 2022" class="main-img">

            <img src="/images/fifa-sound/KizzDaniel_3840x2160.jpg" alt="Music artist Kizz Daniel for FIFA Sound -world cup Qatar 2022" class="main-img">
            <p>Oluwatobiloba Daniel Anidugbe, professionally known as Kizz Daniel is a multi-award-winning Nigerian Afrobeats, Pop, R&B singer, and songwriter. Kizz Daniel is the epitome of an all-around entertainer with a magnetic tone, captivating lyrics, an alluring screen presence and undeniably engaging beats; the irrefutable 
                characteristic of all his songs. </p>
             <p>Founder of Fly Boy Inc record label, which launched operations in 2017, Kizz Daniel hails from Ogun state, where he completed his education, graduating with a degree in Water Resources Management and Agrometeorology in 2013.
            </p>   
            <p>Fresh out of university, Kizz Daniel made an immediate impact with the timeless hit song “Woju” in 2014, , which was named the Hottest Single at the Nigeria Entertainment Awards. In 2015, Kiss Daniel released a follow-up single, "Lave", another sensational hit, on his birthday and two weeks later released the video, which was directed by AJE FILMS and shot in different locations, including the eastern part of Africa. The following year, Kizz released his first studio album, ”New Era”.</p>
            <p>The talented artist has worked with other award-winning artistes such as Wizkid on the sensational song “For you” and Davido on the instant classic “One Ticket”, which trended within 24 hours of its release.

            <p>Nora Fatehi is the most followed Arab artist in the world on Instagram with over 42 million Instagram followers, along with a collective 7+ billion views on YouTube. She became the first Arab African female artist to hit 1 billion on a single unit on YouTube with her hit song, “Dilbar”. Nora was born and raised in Toronto, Canada, by parents of Moroccan origin. She speaks English, Arabic (Moroccan dialect) and Hindi.</p>
            <p>Nora moved to India to pursue her dream in acting and performing in Hindi cinema, debuting in the Hindi action film “Roar: Tigers of the Sunderbans”. She built a successful career through hit movies like Baahubali (with the song “Manohari”) and by dancing in the Indian reality show Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa 9.</p>
            <p>She became an international star with her smash hit “Dilbar”, which was featured in Bollywood movie Satyamave Jayate. The song made her a star overnight as it broke all possible records on all streaming platforms. It was the first song ever to hit 20 million views in less than 24 hours.</p>
            <p>She had made her singing debut back in 2018 when she sang and produced the Arabic-language version of “Dilbar” along with Moroccan band Fnaire, which gained her a huge Arab following.</p>
            <p>Since then, she has received huge acclaim and positive reviews for her role in the movie Batia House, in which she played a small-town girl and also performed another dance number, “O Saki Saki”, another huge hit that racked up 20 million views in less than 24 hours. In 2020, she became a popular judge on India’s Best Dancer, one of the top shows in India, with her presence increasing the show’s ratings.</p>

            <p>Trinidad Cardona is becoming one of pop’s great chameleons. The prolific pop/R&B crooner was launched into the stratosphere following his 2017 smash “Jennifer,” shaking the rafters with a refreshing combo of soulful vocal gymnastics and longing bars about first love and heartbreak. In 2018 he released “Dinero,” a sexy ode to toxic romances that would become a social media sensation nearly two years later with its Miami-flavoured rumba horns and driving beat. What comes next proves that Cardona’s musical voraciousness is reflected across every release, never following the expected path while still 
                delivering lyrical gut punches at every turn.</p>
             <p>In early 2022, Cardona signed to Def Jam Recordings and released the incandescent single “Love Me Back,” a soaring torch song melding hypnotic Afrobeats percussion and shimmering synths. He also appears on the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 soundtrack with “Hayya Hayya (Better Together),” a rousing reggae-meets-EDM anthem calling for global unity and featuring singers DaVido and Aisha. Now, with an album on the horizon, influences from R&B, dancehall, and corridos swirl into songs 
                that capture the richness of the world around him, as well as the one he's forged within.
